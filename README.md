# Grovers-MDGP
Grover's Algorithm Applied to the Molecular Distance Geometry Problem

This project was performed for the Harvard ES 170 Spring 2020 class.

The code is all placed in the attached Jupyter notebook. The graphs are all natively displayed, but the 3D graphs do not render in GitHub.

The associated presentation is also attached.
